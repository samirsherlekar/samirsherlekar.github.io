## On Ocean Acidification

  Earth should have been called ocean, Arthur C. Clarke.

  The earth is made up of 70% of oceans, and it’s the origin of life. But human hubris is altering the chemical constituents of the oceans. We burn fossil fuels to sustain our civilization, and as a result add more carbon into the atmosphere. Everywhere the ocean atmosphere comes into contact, there is an exchange of gasses. Roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of C02 is absorbed by the ocean. Under normal conditions, this would be a good thing, less C02 in the atmosphere, less global warming…right? Wrong. The rate at which C02 is produced and therefore absorbed is far more important than the quantity. There is no analog to the present rate at which C02 is pumped into the atmosphere. It’s like drinking alcohol, the rate at which you get drink will determine how much alcohol is in your blood stream, not necessarily the amount. Colder waters tend to absorb more C02 at a higher rate, than warmer waters. So the arctic regions are far more susceptible to the damages of increased C02. It is hard to predict the biological effects because of the system complexity of the ocean climate, and the difficulty in separating the multiple factors that compound to wreck havoc on the ocean’s ecosystems. However the chemistry of ocean acidification is fairly straight forward. Carbon Dioxide mixes with Water to form Carbonic Acid. Like all acids, it releases positive Hydrogen ions. pH is the relative concentration between H+ ions and OH- ions, so by definition the addition of H+ ions makes the alkaline oceans more acidic. It’s worth noting that the pH scale is logarithmic, so a deceptively small shift in pH can have catastrophic effects on ecosystems. Anyway, those excess H+ ions in the ocean bind to carbonate. 
  
	The fundamental building blocks of ecosystems are typically the creatures we cannot see, like species of plankton. Many types of plankton form  calcium carbonate shells. They have to expend energy to bind calcium and carbonate together. However, H+ and carbonate are more attracted to each other, than calcium and carbonate. Therefore Calicifers need to expend greater energy to build shells with less abundant carbonate, because the H+ is effectively stealing all the carbonate. These calicifers have to make sacrifices, and spend less energy on reproduction, gathering food, and breaking down protiens, and therefore are more susceptible to extinction. Imagine trying to build a house while someone keeps stealing your bricks. 
  
	I’m uncertain of how the erosion of calicifer shells and therefore their survival would ripple up the food chain. But some simple estimation may help. Let’s assume that there are a 10000 plankton. 100 krill each eat 100 plankton. 10 tuna each eat 10 krill. If half the plankton die out, then there are only 5000 plankton. which means only 50 krill can exist. Which means that only 5 tuna can exist.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/samirsherlekar/samirsherlekar.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
